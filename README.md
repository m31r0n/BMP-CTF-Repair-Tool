# BMP-CTF-Repair-Tool
One‑click fixer for broken BMP images found in CTF forensics tasks.  It repairs the most common header tampering tricks — wrong pixel offset, DIB size, file size, and bogus width or height — while leaving 8‑bpp colour palettes intact.  When needed, it can also brute‑force additional dimension variants. 🛠️
